Hello Sir,

I am writing this email on behalf of the whole group to thank you for the time you gave us last Saturday.


This initial interview was extremely useful, both in terms of our choice of specialization in our second year and the important, up-to-date information you provided about the data scientist profession. It also helped us gain a clearer picture of our entire journey at Ensimag to achieve our goals.


We hope to see you again one day. Thank you, and see you soon.


Best regards.
