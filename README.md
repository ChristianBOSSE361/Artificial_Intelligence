# 🧠 Artificial_Intelligence

This repository contains all my personal projects related to Artificial Intelligence, including both Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

For each project, you will generally find:
  - 📅 The project’s start and completion dates;
  - 📂 The dataset(s) used;
  - 📝 A short description of the project and its objectives.

Let's see it in details.
