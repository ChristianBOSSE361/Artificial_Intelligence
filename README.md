# üß† Artificial_Intelligence

This repository contains all my personal projects related to Artificial Intelligence, including both Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

For each project, you will generally find:
  - üìÖ The project‚Äôs start and completion dates;
  - üìÇ The dataset(s) used;
  - üìù A short description of the project and its objectives.

Let's see it in details.

For üìä Machine Learning projects, we have:
  - **Iris Classification**: Classify iris flowers based on petal and sepal measurements.
  - **House Price Detection**: Predict real-estate prices using regression models.
  - **Spam Detection**: Classify emails/messages as spam or not spam.
  - **Sentiment or feelings Detection**: Detect sentiment in text (positive or negative).
  - **Customer Classsification**: Group customers into categories for business insights.

For ü§ñ Deep learning projects, we have:
  - **Image classification**: Build CNN models to classify images into categories.
  - **Image Denoising**: Remove noise from images using autoencoders.
  - **Text Generation**: Generate text using RNNs/LSTMs or Transformers. (not finish)
